# JPACRUDProject
### Description

This application implements a full web-based C.R.U.D. functionality on a MySQL database that I created about computers and specifically graphics cards. It allows the user to manipulate the data from a single table through a web interface. The table has several columns that hold values for different aspects of a graphics card including the name, release date, memory, and price. The user has the option to see all of the objects currently in the database on the main page, as well as being able to create, update, and delete existing entries. The user can also individually look up a graphics card by its id. The web interface is bare-bones but features a simple bootstrap on the main page.

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring MVC
- MySQLWorkbench
- Gradle
- Git and Github
- JPA
- DAO


### Lessons Learned

It can be very difficult to diagnose the exact problem inside of .jsp's so it is important to pay close attention to syntax and variable names. Spring annotations and JPA made this project so much cleaner and easier than the previous MVC film project. It was also very easy to create a database through MySQL workbench and adding more tables seems very doable aside from handling foreign key relationships.
